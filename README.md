Carbohydrate Periodization Index

This is the code and analysis to accompany "The quantification of daily carbohydrate periodization among endurance athletes during 12 weeks of self-selected training: presentation of a novel Carbohydrate Periodization Index".

Because additional analysis is being performed with these data, only a portion of the data points are included, however the full code is presented.
