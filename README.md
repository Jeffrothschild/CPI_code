# CPI code
Carbohydrate Periodization Index

This is the code and analysis to accompany "The quantification of daily carbohydrate periodization among endurance athletes during 12 weeks of self-selected training: presentation of a novel Carbohydrate Periodization Index". This manuscript is currently under review, but a [preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.21.22276725v1) is available.

Data from the study is still being used and analyzed for other purposes, so **a synthetic version of the dataset was created using the {synthpop} pacakge for purposes of running the code.**

I have also made an app for [calculating CPI values](https://rothschild.shinyapps.io/carb-index-app/).
